Stopping Ransomware in real-time
# SYSVOL Watchdog üõ°Ô∏è  
> **Real-time File Monitor for SYSVOL ‚Äì Rename suspicious or unauthorized files before ransomware spreads.**

## üî• Why This Tool?

Ransomware attacks often begin by dropping malicious scripts or policies in the `\\<domain>\SYSVOL` share. These files can automatically execute via GPO or login scripts, affecting the entire network. This tool **monitors the SYSVOL share in real time**, and **renames any new files** before they can execute ‚Äî effectively **disrupting the attack chain**.

## üß† How It Works

- Automatically identifies the domain‚Äôs FQDN and accesses `\\<domain>\SYSVOL`.
- **Renames any new files** every 3 seconds by appending `"aa"` to the filename (e.g., `logon.vbs` ‚Üí `logonaa.vbs`).
- Optionally, renames existing files at startup.
- Runs continuously in the background to **halt ransomware propagation**.
- Logs every action and error for traceability.
